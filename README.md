# Tome - a command-line, plaintext-first citation manager

Tome manages citation in the command-line, using a plain-text file to keep track
of entries. The goal of this is to

- maximise interoperability with other tools, such as Git to synchronise data,
- keep data in a future-proof format, and
- 

## Fetchers

**Note.** Work in progress.

Fetchers are shell commands that Tome invokes to fetch the citation entry
pointed to by a URL.
